The RecGen tool (https://sites.google.com/site/recgentool/) is implemented on top a old Randoop version.
The old Randoop version contains many unfixed bugs. Thus, it seems that RecGen fails to generate compilable
tests for many of the subjects.

For the SAT4J subjects, there seems no way to make the generated tests compilable using simple syntax editting.

For other tests that have compilable errors, we manually correct the syntax problems.

For fair comparison, we remove the calls to main(args) method, which the new version of Randoop ignores.
