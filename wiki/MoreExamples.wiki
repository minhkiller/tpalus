=Example List=

Here, we give more examples on using Palus to automatically create test for complex and highly constrained Java programs. Palus has various configuration options, you may need to change the best option combinations for your own project.

For the following programs, the version used in evaluating Palus could also be downloaded from the [http://code.google.com/p/tpalus/downloads/list downloads] tab

==TinySQL DBMS engine==

tinySQL is a lightweight, 100% Java SQL engine that also includes a JDBC driver. It could be downloaded [http://www.jepstone.net/tinySQL/ here]

==SAT4J Solver==

SAT4J is an efficient solver for SAT problems. It could be downloaded [http://www.sat4j.org/ here]

==Rhino Java Script Interpreter==

Rhino is an open-source implementation of JavaScript written entirely in Java. It is typically embedded into Java applications to provide scripting to end users. It could be downloaded [http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/ here]


==Apache Common Collections==

The Java Collections Framework was a major addition in JDK 1.2. It added many powerful data structures that accelerate development of most significant Java applications. It could be downloaded [http://commons.apache.org/collections/ here].

=Comparison with Randoop=

A part of Palus is built on top of the Randoop test generation engine. Palus' release jar contains a slightly modified Randoop version (fixing known bugs and some syntax edits to relax method visibility for extension). You can use all invoke Randoop using the following command:

{{{java -cp palus-0.1.jar:$YOUR_CLASS_PATH randoop.main.Main [http://randoop.googlecode.com/hg/doc/index.html#command-line-options randoop_args]
}}}
