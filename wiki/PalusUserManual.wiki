= What is Palus? =

Palus is an automated test generation tool, which combines various static and dynamic analysis to create tests for Java programs in the JUnit form.


= How to use Palus? =

*In short*: see its help manual. 

Execute the following command:

java -cp ./palus-0.1.jar:./asm-all-3.1.jar:./plume.jar palus.main.OfflineMain --help


== Example 1 (a toy example) ===

The needed class files are included in the palus-0.1.jar.

1. put palus-0.1.jar in a folder, denoted as PALUS_DIR

2. download two dependent jars (plume.jar, asm-all-3.1.jar) from the download tab, and put them all into the PALUS_DIR folder

3. enter PALUS_DIR

4. run a sample execution:

   java -javaagent:./palus-0.1.jar=toydb -cp ./palus-0.1.jar:./asm-all-3.1.jar:$CLASSPATH database.Main

5. Palus will record the captured trace and save to a (binary) file in PALUS_DIR folder, named *toy_db_trace.model* (there might be another file called: toy_db_trace.txt. This is the human-readable trace text for error diagnose and performance tuning)

6. Download the toydatabase.txt file from the download tab. This file contains several classes to test for the toy example. Put this file to the PALUS_DIR.

   Execute the following command to generate tests:

   java -cp ./palus-0.1.jar:./asm-all-3.1.jar:./plume.jar palus.main.OfflineMain --time_limit 10 --class_file ./toydatabase.txt --trace_file ./toydb_trace.model

== Example 2 (a real-world program: bcel 5.2 library) ===

The first 2 steps are the same with *Example 1*

1. put palus-0.1.jar in a folder, denoted as PALUS_DIR

2. download two dependent jars (plume.jar, asm-all-3.1.jar) from the download tab, and put them all into the PALUS_DIR folder

3. download the *bcel-5.2-exp.jar* from the download tab. Palus will generate tests for this library

4. enter PALUS_DIR

5. run a sample execution:

   java -javaagent:./palus-0.1.jar=bcel -cp ./palus-0.1.jar:./asm-all-3.1.jar:./bcel-5.2-exp.jar:$CLASSPATH org.apache.bcel.util.BCELifier org.apache.bcel.util.CodeHTML

6. Palus will record the captured trace and save to a (binary) file in PALUS_DIR folder, named *bcel_trace.model* (there might be another file called: bcel_trace.txt. This is the human-readable trace text for error diagnose and performance tuning)

7. Download the bcelclass.txt file from the download tab. This file contains all classes of the bcel library. Put this file to the PALUS_DIR.

   Execute the following command to generate tests:

   java -Xmx2G -cp ./palus-0.1.jar:./asm-all-3.1.jar:./plume.jar:./bcel-5.2-exp.jar palus.main.OfflineMain --time_limit 150 --class_file ./bcelclass.txt --trace_file ./bcel_trace.model --switch_time_to_random 6000 --process_large_trace

*Notice: * The options *--switch_time_to_random 6000 * and *--process_large_trace* is used for efficient test generation for large trace files.

===where to find the generated tests?===

In the above 2 examples, all generated tests will reside in $PALUS_DIR/tests folder, under the tests package

==Writing Project-Specific Testing Oracle for Effective Bug Finding==

Palus integrates the [http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/40090/MIT-CSAIL-TR-2008-002.pdf theory] framework in [http://www.junit.org/ JUnit] into the test generation engine. This permits programmers to write project-specific testing oracles, and Palus will automatically check its correctness during test generation.

Here is an example from the Junit theory [http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/40090/MIT-CSAIL-TR-2008-002.pdf theory] paper, suppose we are testing the bag data structure in apache-common-collections. We could write a general specification for the bag class as follows:

{{{
@RunWith(Theories.class)
public class ApacheCollectionTheory {
  @Theory
  public void bagAddItemToContainIt(Bag bag, Object item) {
   Assume.assumeTrue(bag != null && item !=null);
   try {
       bag.add(item);
   } catch (Exception e) {
     Assert.assertTrue(false);
   }
   Assert.assertTrue(bag.contains(item));
  }
}
}}}

The above simple theory specify the specification that each bag implementation should obey. That is, there should be no exception when adding non-null items to a bag, and after the add operation, the bag should contain the added item.

Users could simply put this class to the classlist.txt file as the input of Palus. Palus will automatically extract the theory and check its correctness, when it sees a Bag and Object instances during testing generation. This simple theory find several violations (bugs) in the latest apache-common release.

*Note*: please turn on the option *--use-theory-check* when starting Palus.
